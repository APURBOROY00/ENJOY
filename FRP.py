"""
Other known long poem "Pieces of Hope" by Patrick Huet, has nearly 7,600 verses written on a roll of fabric that stretches to almost one kilometer. The poem is not published. Other really long poems were written by ancient Persia or India poets and an example is, Mahabharata.


So here’s your turn. Don’t shy away from sharing your longest piece of poetry with me. I’d be pleased!

The world's longest English poem is not 'The Blah Story, Volume 8'. It is 'Oleander Smile', published by LuLu (www.LuLu.com). The poem is huge: 40,040 lines long! No other published english poem since the 11th century comes close, not even Nigel Tomm's.

I can't speak as these alleged poems on Lulu.com. And I doubt if you can call Blah a poem. However, Spenser's Fairie Queen at 35,000 lines plus (three times the length of Paradise Lost)is probably the longest significant poem in English. Lydgate's Troy Book and Fall Of Princes are also of significant length.

Reply

UnknownJuly 31, 2016 at 11:45 PM
Lydgate's Fall of Princes is the longest English poem at over 44, 000 lines, closely followed by Edmund Spenser's Faerie Queene at 36, 000 plus lines!

Beyond The Ocean
It’s time
For me to go
It’s a shame I couldn’t stay
Now I have to go
So off I set
In my boat
Sailing
Into the unknown

The ocean
No one knows where it goes
When one can no longer stay
They must go
And journey
Into the ocean
Where no one returns

The perilous sea
No one can go back
Some go there with time
Some, forcefully
In the end
We all go
Beyond the ocean
Peacefully
Or ruefully

Ocean
So blue
Where we ride the waves
To where no one knows

Where I go now
Some say a paradise
Some say hell
It doesn’t matter where I go now
Because the land behind me
Got bored of me
And threw me away into the
Great
Blue
Sea

Heaven
Hell
It doesn’t matter
I’ll cross the ocean and into the next
Where i’ll one day meet land
And then probably do it again

Endless blue
Where will you take me?
Is it my first or my last?
Don’t cast me aside just yet
Let me reach land
Repeat from step one
Or just stay
Who knows?

I’ll go to a place of no return
And one day meet you again
So just you wait
For the day we meet
Again

I can't speak as these alleged poems on Lulu.com. And I doubt if you can call Blah a poem. However, Spenser's Fairie Queen at 35,000 lines plus (three times the length of Paradise Lost)is probably the longest significant poem in English. Lydgate's Troy Book and Fall Of Princes are also of significant length.

Lydgate's Fall of Princes is the longest English poem at over 44, 000 lines, closely followed by Edmund Spenser's Faerie Queene at 36, 000 plus lines!

Beyond The Ocean
It’s time
For me to go
It’s a shame I couldn’t stay
Now I have to go
So off I set
In my boat
Sailing
Into the unknown

The ocean
No one knows where it goes
When one can no longer stay
They must go
And journey
Into the ocean
Where no one returns

The perilous sea
No one can go back
Some go there with time
Some, forcefully
In the end
We all go
Beyond the ocean
Peacefully
Or ruefully

Ocean
So blue
Where we ride the waves
To where no one knows

Where I go now
Some say a paradise
Some say hell
It doesn’t matter where I go now
Because the land behind me
Got bored of me
And threw me away into the
Great
Blue
Sea

Heaven
Hell
It doesn’t matter
I’ll cross the ocean and into the next
Where i’ll one day meet land
And then probably do it again

Endless blue
Where will you take me?
Is it my first or my last?
Don’t cast me aside just yet
Let me reach land
Repeat from step one
Or just stay
Who knows?

I’ll go to a place of no return
And one day meet you again
So just you wait
For the day we meet
Again

Beyond the ocean
Other known long poem "Pieces of Hope" by Patrick Huet, has nearly 7,600 verses written on a roll of fabric that stretches to almost one kilometer. The poem is not published. Other really long poems were written by ancient Persia or India poets and an example is, Mahabharata.


So here’s your turn. Don’t shy away from sharing your longest piece of poetry with me. I’d be pleased!

The world's longest English poem is not 'The Blah Story, Volume 8'. It is 'Oleander Smile', published by LuLu (www.LuLu.com). The poem is huge: 40,040 lines long! No other published english poem since the 11th century comes close, not even Nigel Tomm's.

I can't speak as these alleged poems on Lulu.com. And I doubt if you can call Blah a poem. However, Spenser's Fairie Queen at 35,000 lines plus (three times the length of Paradise Lost)is probably the longest significant poem in English. Lydgate's Troy Book and Fall Of Princes are also of significant length.

Lydgate's Fall of Princes is the longest English poem at over 44, 000 lines, closely followed by Edmund Spenser's Faerie Queene at 36, 000 plus lines!

Beyond The Ocean
It’s time
For me to go
It’s a shame I couldn’t stay
Now I have to go
So off I set
In my boat
Sailing
Into the unknown

The ocean
No one knows where it goes
When one can no longer stay
They must go
And journey
Into the ocean
Where no one returns

The perilous sea
No one can go back
Some go there with time
Some, forcefully
In the end
We all go
Beyond the ocean
Peacefully
Or ruefully

Ocean
So blue
Where we ride the waves
To where no one knows

Where I go now
Some say a paradise
Some say hell
It doesn’t matter where I go now
Because the land behind me
Got bored of me
And threw me away into the
Great
Blue
Sea

Heaven
Hell
It doesn’t matter
I’ll cross the ocean and into the next
Where i’ll one day meet land
And then probably do it again

Endless blue
Where will you take me?
Is it my first or my last?
Don’t cast me aside just yet
Let me reach land
Repeat from step one
Or just stay
Who knows?

I’ll go to a place of no return
And one day meet you again
So just you wait
For the day we meet
Again

Beyond the ocean
Other known long poem "Pieces of Hope" by Patrick Huet, has nearly 7,600 verses written on a roll of fabric that stretches to almost one kilometer. The poem is not published. Other really long poems were written by ancient Persia or India poets and an example is, Mahabharata.


So here’s your turn. Don’t shy away from sharing your longest piece of poetry with me. I’d be pleased!

The world's longest English poem is not 'The Blah Story, Volume 8'. It is 'Oleander Smile', published by LuLu (www.LuLu.com). The poem is huge: 40,040 lines long! No other published english poem since the 11th century comes close, not even Nigel Tomm's.

I can't speak as these alleged poems on Lulu.com. And I doubt if you can call Blah a poem. However, Spenser's Fairie Queen at 35,000 lines plus (three times the length of Paradise Lost)is probably the longest significant poem in English. Lydgate's Troy Book and Fall Of Princes are also of significant length.

Lydgate's Fall of Princes is the longest English poem at over 44, 000 lines, closely followed by Edmund Spenser's Faerie Queene at 36, 000 plus lines!

Beyond The Ocean
It’s time
For me to go
It’s a shame I couldn’t stay
Now I have to go
So off I set
In my boat
Sailing
Into the unknown

The ocean
No one knows where it goes
When one can no longer stay
They must go
And journey
Into the ocean
Where no one returns

The perilous sea
No one can go back
Some go there with time
Some, forcefully
In the end
We all go
Beyond the ocean
Peacefully
Or ruefully

Ocean
So blue
Where we ride the waves
To where no one knows

Where I go now
Some say a paradise
Some say hell
It doesn’t matter where I go now
Because the land behind me
Got bored of me
And threw me away into the
Great
Blue
Sea

Heaven
Hell
It doesn’t matter
I’ll cross the ocean and into the next
Where i’ll one day meet land
And then probably do it again

Endless blue
Where will you take me?
Is it my first or my last?
Don’t cast me aside just yet
Let me reach land
Repeat from step one
Or just stay
Who knows?

I’ll go to a place of no return
And one day meet you again
So just you wait
For the day we meet
Again

Beyond the ocean
Other known long poem "Pieces of Hope" by Patrick Huet, has nearly 7,600 verses written on a roll of fabric that stretches to almost one kilometer. The poem is not published. Other really long poems were written by ancient Persia or India poets and an example is, Mahabharata.


So here’s your turn. Don’t shy away from sharing your longest piece of poetry with me. I’d be pleased!

The world's longest English poem is not 'The Blah Story, Volume 8'. It is 'Oleander Smile', published by LuLu (www.LuLu.com). The poem is huge: 40,040 lines long! No other published english poem since the 11th century comes close, not even Nigel Tomm's.

I think you will find my poem..THE JAW is longer than that, My poem is over 100.000 words long and all rhymes. My now published book(lulu.com)is a story, not just loads of poems chucked into a book, Check out lulu.com for more K.A.SHAW

The world's longest English poem is not 'The Blah Story, Volume 8'. It is 'Oleander Smile', published by LuLu (www.LuLu.com). The poem is huge: 40,040 lines long! No other published english poem since the 11th century comes close, not even Nigel Tomm's.

I can't speak as these alleged poems on Lulu.com. And I doubt if you can call Blah a poem. However, Spenser's Fairie Queen at 35,000 lines plus (three times the length of Paradise Lost)is probably the longest significant poem in English. Lydgate's Troy Book and Fall Of Princes are also of significant length.

Lydgate's Fall of Princes is the longest English poem at over 44, 000 lines, closely followed by Edmund Spenser's Faerie Queene at 36, 000 plus lines!

Beyond The Ocean
It’s time
For me to go
It’s a shame I couldn’t stay
Now I have to go
So off I set
In my boat
Sailing
Into the unknown

The ocean
No one knows where it goes
When one can no longer stay
They must go
And journey
Into the ocean
Where no one returns

The perilous sea
No one can go back
Some go there with time
Some, forcefully
In the end
We all go
Beyond the ocean
Peacefully
Or ruefully

Ocean
So blue
Where we ride the waves
To where no one knows

Where I go now
Some say a paradise
Some say hell
It doesn’t matter where I go now
Because the land behind me
Got bored of me
And threw me away into the
Great
Blue
Sea

Heaven
Hell
It doesn’t matter
I’ll cross the ocean and into the next
Where i’ll one day meet land
And then probably do it again

Endless blue
Where will you take me?
Is it my first or my last?
Don’t cast me aside just yet
Let me reach land
Repeat from step one
Or just stay
Who knows?

I’ll go to a place of no return
And one day meet you again
So just you wait
For the day we meet
Again

Beyond the ocean

Where i’ll one day meet land
And then probably do it again

Endless blue
Where will you take me?
Is it my first or my last?
Don’t cast me aside just yet
Let me reach land
Repeat from step one
Or just stay
Who knows?

I’ll go to a place of no return
And one day meet you again
So just you wait
For the day we meet
Again

Beyond the ocean

The world's longest English poem is not 'The Blah Story, Volume 8'. It is 'Oleander Smile', published by LuLu (www.LuLu.com). The poem is huge: 40,040 lines long! No other published english poem since the 11th century comes close, not even Nigel Tomm's.

I can't speak as these alleged poems on Lulu.com. And I doubt if you can call Blah a poem. However, Spenser's Fairie Queen at 35,000 lines plus (three times the length of Paradise Lost)is probably the longest significant poem in English. Lydgate's Troy Book and Fall Of Princes are also of significant length.

Lydgate's Fall of Princes is the longest English poem at over 44, 000 lines, closely followed by Edmund Spenser's Faerie Queene at 36, 000 plus lines!

Beyond The Ocean
It’s time
For me to go
It’s a shame I couldn’t stay
Now I have to go
So off I set
In my boat
Sailing
Into the unknown

The ocean
No one knows where it goes
When one can no longer stay
They must go
And journey
Into the ocean
Where no one returns

The perilous sea
No one can go back
Some go there with time
Some, forcefully
In the end
We all go
Beyond the ocean
Peacefully
Or ruefully

Ocean
So blue
Where we ride the waves
To where no one knows

Where I go now
Some say a paradise
Some say hell
It doesn’t matter where I go now
Because the land behind me
Got bored of me
And threw me away into the
Great
Blue
Sea

Heaven
Hell
It doesn’t matter
I’ll cross the ocean and into the next
Where i’ll one day meet land
And then probably do it again

Endless blue
Where will you take me?
Is it my first or my last?
Don’t cast me aside just yet
Let me reach land
Repeat from step one
Or just stay
Who knows?

I’ll go to a place of no return
And one day meet you again
So just you wait

Beyond The Ocean
It’s time
For me to go
It’s a shame I couldn’t stay
Now I have to go
So off I set
In my boat
Sailing
Into the unknown

The ocean
No one knows where it goes
When one can no longer stay
They must go
And journey
Into the ocean
Where no one returns

The perilous sea
No one can go back
Some go there with time
Some, forcefully
In the end
We all go
Beyond the ocean
Peacefully
Or ruefully

Ocean
So blue
Where we ride the waves
To where no one knows

Where I go now
Some say a paradise
Some say hell
It doesn’t matter where I go now
Because the land behind me
Got bored of me
And threw me away into the
Great
Blue
Sea

Heaven
Hell
It doesn’t matter
I’ll cross the ocean and into the next
Where i’ll one day meet land
And then probably do it again

Endless blue
Where will you take me?
Is it my first or my last?
Don’t cast me aside just yet
Let me reach land
Repeat from step one
Or just stay
Who knows?

I’ll go to a place of no return
And one day meet you again
So just you wait
For the day we meet
Again

Beyond the ocean
Other known long poem "Pieces of Hope" by Patrick Huet, has nearly 7,600 verses written on a roll of fabric that stretches to almost one kilometer. The poem is not published. Other really long poems were written by ancient Persia or India poets and an example is, Mahabharata.


So here’s your turn. Don’t shy away from sharing your longest piece of poetry with me. I’d be pleased!

The world's longest English poem is not 'The Blah Story, Volume 8'. It is 'Oleander Smile', published by LuLu (www.LuLu.com). The poem is huge: 40,040 lines long! No other published english poem since the 11th century comes close, not even Nigel Tomm's.

I can't speak as these alleged poems on Lulu.com. And I doubt if you can call Blah a poem. However, Spenser's Fairie Queen at 35,000 lines plus (three times the length of Paradise Lost)is probably the longest significant poem in English. Lydgate's Troy Book and Fall Of Princes are also of significant length.
